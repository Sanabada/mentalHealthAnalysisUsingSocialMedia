# mentalHealthAnalysisUsingSocialMedia
A data visualization project for mental health analysis using social media impact and behavioural patterns

Mental health is increasingly recognized as a critical component of overall well-being. In today's fast-paced and digitally driven world, behaviors like excessive screen time, poor sleep, high stress levels, and social media dependence are common. These lifestyle attributes have been linked to various mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and stress disorders. 
				While social media has numerous advantages in enabling connectivity, it also contributes to social comparison, poor sleep hygiene, and digital fatigue. Understanding these complex patterns requires data-driven approaches. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict mental health risks by analyzing behavioral and social media usage data. Such predictive insights can guide early interventions and raise awareness.


This is combined project using Tableau, powerBI and python for Data Analysis proess.
